# Why was Pandas Created?

Pandas was created in order to get "better performance" than excel around 2007 by Wes McKinney. 

If you would like to learn more about the history of pandas, refer to this website

# How to Install Pandas?
1. Open up a new terminal window

2. Type in and run "pip install pandas"

If you want to install pandas through the anaconda distribution, refer to this website

# Creating a pandas dataframe
1. Now you can import pandas in your text editor of choice in python and save it as the common alias of pd
2. Read in the data using the pd.read_csv() function

Don't forget to have the dataset saved in the same directory as where your python file is located at.

3. The type of the df object is now a pandas DataFrame

4. At this point, you no longer need to explicitly reference the alias pd since we have already loaded the data using pandas. The data is now a pandas object which means we can now use the different features of pandas.

5. You can use the set_index() function on a column in the dataset that is a unique value for the dataset. From there you can use the .loc with the square brackets in order to subset the dataset based on one of the new index values.

# Multi-Level Indexing

In order to understand multi-level indexing, you would first need to understand indexing at a single level. 

Once you are trying to index based on multiple levels, then the two column values that you want to become your indeces should give you a unique value when used together.

Basically a glorified way to access elements after a group by occurs. 



Except it is not actually a group by that makes a pandas data frame have multiple index levels. You choose a column that you want to set the index to (so the column has to have more of a unique value per row), and then you are able to slice your data frame based on two different indeces. 



If you would like another example of multi indeces, refer to data camp's explanation
