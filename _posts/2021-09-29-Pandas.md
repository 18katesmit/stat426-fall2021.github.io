# Why was Pandas Created?

Pandas was created in order to get "better performance" than excel around 2007 by Wes McKinney. 

If you would like to learn more about the history of pandas, refer to this website

# How to Install Pandas?
1. Open up a new terminal window

2. Type in and run "pip install pandas"

If you want to install pandas through the anaconda distribution, refer to this website

# Creating a pandas dataframe
1. Now you can import pandas in your text editor of choice in python and save it as the common alias of pd
2. Read in the data using the pd.read_csv() function

Don't forget to have the dataset saved in the same directory as where your python file is located at. If it is not in the same location then it will give you an error saying that it does not recognize the .csv file name.

3. The type of the df object is now a pandas DataFrame which gives us a lot of data manipulation power.

4. At this point, you no longer need to explicitly reference the alias pd since we have already loaded the data using pandas. The data is now a pandas object which means we can now use the different features of pandas.

5. You can use the set_index() function on a column in the dataset that is a unique value for the dataset. From there you can use the .loc with the square brackets in order to subset the dataset based on one of the new index values. Here I reference the Student_ID of 1 which returns the associated information with that index.

# Multi-Level Indexing

In order to understand multi-level indexing, you would first need to understand indexing at a single level. Now that we have run through a single level indexing example, we can move onto looking at multi-level indexing.

1. Read in the new data set that has a little bit more information. You can see that Student 1 is in several classes each with a different letter grade.

2. Once you are trying to index based on multiple levels, then the two column values that you want to become your indeces should give you a unique value when used together. Use .set_index() on Student_ID and Class in order to be able to find the unique grade for that combination of information.

3. Now when you sort the index you can see how the different levels of the index are set up with the Student_ID being "grouped" together with each of the classes that student is taking.

4. The order does matter when trying to subset the dataframe using the multiple indeces. If you have the order wrong you will get a KeyError saying that it doesn't recognize the index that you are trying to use.

5. Since I created my multiple indeces based on the Student_ID first and then the class, I need to index in that order. And when I index in the correct order, I get the letter grade of A back.

6. If you are needing to add another dataset vertically onto the original dataset (meaning that the columns will match up with the previous information), then you can use the pandas concat function.

<img width="484" alt="Screen Shot 2021-09-24 at 9 55 20 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77635875/134705063-6cffee9b-1683-435b-aae8-043995c2cc7a.png">

This shows the new student information added to the previous dataset.
