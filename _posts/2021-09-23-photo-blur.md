# Create a Blog Post Title Picture

A cool way to make your blog title stand out, is to blur a picture and add the text of your blog title in bold letters, as in the example below.

There are many ways that this can be done, but this is the method that I used.  

Note that
these instructions were created using PowerPoint for Mac.  On Windows, the idea is the same, but the menus might be in slightly different places.  See [this post](https://www.howtogeek.com/437476/how-to-blur-an-image-in-powerpoint/) for Windows illustrations, at least for the photo blurring section.

## Blurring the Photo


    1.  Open your photo in PowerPoint (Insert --> Picture --> Picture from file) or simply drag the file of the photo into a PowerPoint Page.

    2. Select the picture.  When the picture is selected a new top menu should appear named "Picture Format".  Select that menu and then find the arrow next to "Artistic Effects".

    3.  Click the arrow next to "Artistic Effects" and choose the "Blur" option.  Your picture is now blurred, but the default effect is quite subtle.

    4.  To change the level of blurring, go back to "Artistic Effects" and select "Artistic Effects Options".  This will open the "Format Picture" pane on the right.  Select the "Effects" tab (the pentagon), then "Artistic Effects" and adjust the radius.

The higher the radius, the more blurred the picture will be.  See the figure below with examples of radius 20, 50, and 85.

## Adding Text

1. Create a new text box
2. Change text color to white
3. Increase text size to 54
4. Bold the text
5. Add a subtle shadow
    * Double click on the text box to open the "Format Shape" menu on the right
    * Select the "Text Options" tab and then select the "Text Effects" tab
    * Expand the "Shadow" option and open the "Presets" dropdown menu.  Select the first option under "Outer".
    * Position the textbox in the center of the blurred photo.
