# Automating a Python Script on a Mac
## First up, you need a python script that you want to run. Mine is pulling COVID data from an API. Don't worry too much about all the specifics of the code, I will comment next to the relevant lines.
#  import libraries
import pandas as pd
import requests
import datetime

# set path where you want the data to be downloaded
path='/Users/rexmoss/School/stat426/blog/'

# get timestamp
now = datetime.datetime.now()

date = str(now.year - 1) + '-' + str(now.month) + '-' + str(now.day)
url = "https://covid-19-statistics.p.rapidapi.com/reports/total"
querystring = {"date":date}

headers = {
    'x-rapidapi-host': "covid-19-statistics.p.rapidapi.com",
    'x-rapidapi-key': "a17b3487cdmsh3d9305fa3e72fa9p183f80jsn0cf4047b3692"
    }

response = requests.request("GET", url, headers=headers, params=querystring)
j = response.json()
df = pd.json_normalize(j)

# save data to a csv with a timestamp
df.to_csv(path+str(now)+'covid')

## Now that I have my python script, it's time to automate it. To do this, I first need to make my script executable. Follow the steps below to do this.
### 1. Open the terminal and run pip install pyinstaller. This will install PyInstaller.
### 2. Inside the terminal, navigate to the directory where your script is located.
### 3. Once youâ€˜re in the path where your script is located, run the following 'pyinstaller --onefile example.py' in the terminal to make the script executable.
### 4. You should see a message that includes "completed successfully." Then in the directory where your script is located, you should see a folder named "dist". Click inside that folder and you will find the executable. You'll need to know the path to this executable, so keep this in mind for later.

## Okay now your python script is executable - hooray! Next up, we are going to automate this script to run at a specified interval by using crontab.

### 1. Open the terminal and run crontab -e.
### 2. Press 'i' to activate the INSERT mode.
### 3. Use crontab.guru to write how often you want the script to run.
### (example: '* * * * *' would make the script run every minute)
### 4. After you specify when the script will run, press SPACE, put the path to the executable you just created, press SPACE again, and put the path to your script.
### (example: * * * * * /path/to/my/executable /path/to/my/script)
### 5. Press esc. and then type :wq to save and exit (w - write, q - quit) and then press enter.

## To make sure that the crontab was created, type 'crontab -l' in the terminal and you should see it. To edit the crontab, type 'crontab -e'. To remove the crontab, type 'crontab -r'.

## Congrats, you just automated your python script!

### A few things to know: 
### - If you have don't have the right permissions, you need to give full disk access. Click System Preferences, Security and Privacy, Privacy, and Full Disk Access and then grant access.
### - If for whatever reason your crontab is not working, you can type 'mail' in the terminal and then press enter to see potential error messages.
