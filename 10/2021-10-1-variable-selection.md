### Introduction
Introduction
Linear regression models are one of the most basic and stastistical predictive modeling methods because of their simplicity and interpretability. They are extremely useful in quantifying how one variable can impact an outcome variable as well as how multiple variables may interact with one another. These models, however, are not without its own obstacles. One of the most common obstacles that statisticians encounter while fitting linear models is multicolinearity in which explanatory variables are linearly related thus unsatifying the assumption of variable independence and greatly affecting the final results of a linear model. This blog discusses variable selection models such as best subsets model, backward selection, and sequential which are remedial measures available to fit an effective and reliable linear model.

We use an example dataset to illustrate these methods.
